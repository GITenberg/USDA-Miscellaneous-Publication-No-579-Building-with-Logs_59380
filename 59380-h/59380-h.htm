<p>The art of log construction is relatively simple, once a few
basic principles are understood. The pioneers who opened
the lands beyond the eastern seaboard did not have boards
with which to build such shelter as they needed. Logs were
so plentiful in the forested area of our country that, with
their resourceful ingenuity, the settlers built their homes
in conformity with those principles of log construction which
prevailed in the countries from which they migrated. Those
principles have remained the same down through the years.</p>

<p>The pioneer had but an ax for a tool and consequently
made only those articles which could be hewed out of wood.
Today there are many tools available, and to do a first class
job of log construction one must know how to handle the
double-bitted or single-bitted ax, the broadax, saw, adz,
chisel, slick, ship auger, and drawknife. In this bulletin
it is assumed that the reader is familiar with the ordinary
frame building methods used where wood is the principal
construction material.</p>

<p class="caption2"><a name="BUILDING_THE_FOUNDATION" id="BUILDING_THE_FOUNDATION">BUILDING THE FOUNDATION</a></p>


<p>A building should have a good foundation, and a log structure
is no exception to the rule. For the sake of economy in labor and
material it is sufficient, in some instances, to place small buildings
on piers of concrete or rough native stone, but usually it will be
more satisfactory to use continuous walls of stone masonry or concrete
to provide uninterrupted support for the logs and thus avoid
their tendency to sag. These walls, however, should be provided
with small openings for the circulation of air to prevent the wood
from dry rotting. Furthermore, the continuous foundation wall has
the additional advantage of preventing rodents from getting under
the building. In no case should the logs be placed directly upon
the ground since wood tends to decay when in contact with the earth.</p>

<p>The two end walls of the exterior foundation should be higher
than the side walls in order to offset the difference in level of the
logs on adjacent walls, the end-wall logs being half their thickness
higher than those on the side walls.</p>

<p>In building a log wall the chief problem is in closing the opening
between each pair of logs. There are various ways of doing this,
but only those regarded as most satisfactory will be described in
this publication. The width of such openings is affected by several
factors: (1) The manner of placing the logs upon each other;
(2) the type of corner used where two walls meet; (3) the openings
for doors and windows; and (4) the natural shrinkage of wood in
the process of drying.</p>



<hr class="chap" />

<p class="caption2"><a name="PREPARING_THE_LOGS" id="PREPARING_THE_LOGS">PREPARING THE LOGS</a></p>


<p>The selection of straight, smooth, even-sized logs is the prime
consideration (<a href="#fig_1">fig. 1</a>). Top diameters should be as uniform as possible,
but as a rule not less than 10 nor more than 12 inches. (Slightly<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_2" id="Page_2">« 2 »</a></span>
smaller or larger dimensions may be used if no others are available.)
The taper should be as slight as possible. For logs longer than 40 feet,
the top diameter may be less than 10 inches in order to avoid an
excessive diameter at the large or butt end.</p>

</div>

<p>Cedar, pine, fir, and larch, in the order named, are most desirable
for log construction. All knots, limbs, or bumps should be trimmed
off carefully when the log is peeled. It is best to cut the logs in
late fall or winter, for two important reasons: (1) Logs cut in
spring or summer peel easier, but crack or check to an undesirable
degree while seasoning. (2) Insect activity is dormant during the
winter months; hence, if the logs are cut and seasoned then, they
are less liable to damage by insects or rot-producing fungi.</p>

<p>Logs should be cut, peeled, and laid on skids well above the ground
for at least 6 months before being placed in the building. This may
not always be possible, but it is a good rule to follow. Logs should
be stored in a single deck with 2 or 3 inches between them to permit
complete exposure to the air. Logs having a sweep or curve should
be piled with the curve uppermost so that their weight will tend
to straighten them while they are drying. Where the skidding space
is limited, logs may be double-decked, using poles between tiers.
Unrestricted air circulation materially aids seasoning.</p>

<p>Sort the logs carefully before starting construction, using the
better ones in the front or other conspicuous walls of the building.
If the logs are not uniform in size, the larger ones should be placed
at the bottom of the walls.</p>

<p class="caption2"><a name="DIMENSIONS_OF_THE_BUILDING" id="DIMENSIONS_OF_THE_BUILDING">DIMENSIONS OF THE BUILDING</a></p>


<p>For practical reasons the dimensions of a log building are the
inside measurements taken from one log to the corresponding log
in the opposite wall. Outside dimensions vary somewhat with the
size of the logs, thus accounting for the use of inside measurements.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_3" id="Page_3">« 3 »</a></span>
Where projecting corners are desired, logs should be at least 6 feet
longer than the inside dimensions of the building. In erecting the
walls, the logs should be kept even or plumb on the inside faces if
it is desired to finish the interior with wallboard or plaster.</p>

<p>The corner is one of the most important aspects of log construction.
On it the appearance and stability of the structure depend.
Different types of corner construction are in use in the United States,
each varying in accordance with local building customs or individual
taste.</p>

<p>The round-notch, or saddle, corner (<a href="#fig_2">fig. 2</a>) is generally considered
the most satisfactory from every standpoint. This type of corner
gives the most distinctive appearance because the logs project sufficiently
beyond the corner not to appear dubbed off (<a href="#fig_3">fig. 3</a>). It is
a good, self-locking, mechanical joint, relatively easy to construct,
and holds the logs rigidly in place.</p>

<div class="fig_caption"><span class="smcap">Figure 4.</span>&mdash;Method of marking saddle corners.</div>
</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">« 6 »</a></span></p>

<p>In cutting the saddle, the material is taken out of the under side
of the upper log without disturbing the top surface of the bottom
log. All the moisture thus drains out at the corner and, consequently,
the wood is much less subject to decay than if other types
of corners were used. The shrinkage in the outer area of the log&rsquo;s
circumference tends to open up the space between the logs. Finally,
in the round-notch corner, one-half of the shrinkage between the
logs is allowed to remain in the corner. The separation, therefore,
is not as great as if each log had been cut down to the heartwood,
a disadvantage common to most other types of corners.</p>

<p>The tools required to make a round-notch or saddle corner are:
A pair of log dogs to hold the log in place, 10- or 12-inch wing
dividers with pencil holder and level-bubble attachment, sharp ax,
2-inch gouge chisel with outside bevel, crosscut saw, spirit level, and
plumb board. The framing of this corner, described in <a href="#fig_4">figure 4</a>,
should be relatively easy.</p>

<div class="fig_left" style="width: 218px;">
<a id="fig_5" name="fig_5"></a>
<img src="images/fig5.png" width="218" height="269" alt="" />
<div class="fig_caption"><span class="smcap">Figure 5.</span>&mdash;Chopping the notch in a saddle corner.</div>
</div>

<p>First, the bottom logs should be set in place on opposite sides of
the foundation. Hew a flat face of 2 to 3 inches in width on the
under side of the log where it rests on the foundation, so that it will
lay in place. Then place the bottom log on each end-wall and
accurately center it so that the inside face of all four logs is to
the exact interior dimensions of the building. Dog the logs into
place so they will not move while being marked for the corner notch.
The wing divider is now set for one-half the diameter of the side
log. With the lower leg of the divider resting on the side of the
under log and the other leg, with the level-bubble uppermost, resting
against the bottom of the upper log and directly above the lower
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">« 7 »</a></span>
log, start moving the divider upward, with a side motion, so that the
lower leg follows the curvature of the under log. The pencil point
of the upper leg makes a mark on the surface of the upper log which
will be the intersection of the surfaces of the two logs when the
notch has been cut from the upper one. Repeat this operation four
times to mark all four sides of the corner. A little practice will
make you adept at keeping the points of the divider perpendicular
to each other.</p>

<p>After the notch has been marked at both ends of the log, turn
it over on its back. It is a good idea to intensify the divider mark
with an indelible pencil so that it will be easily followed. Chop the
notch out roughly, as illustrated in <a href="#fig_5">figure 5</a>, then chip down as
closely as possible to the mark, supplying the finishing touches with
a gouge chisel. The finished notch should be cupped out just enough
to allow the weight of the log to come on the outside edges, thus
insuring a tight joint.</p>

<p>When the next side log is rolled into place, the dividers should
be set apart for the width of the space between the top of the first
and the bottom of the following log, and the marking repeated as
before. If you wish to have the upper log &ldquo;ride&rdquo; the lower one a
little, so that an especially tight joint is obtained, the dividers should
be set a little wider apart than the space actually requires.</p>


<p class="caption3"><a id="Other_Log_Corners" name="Other_Log_Corners"></a>Other Log Corners</p>

<p>The dovetail, or box, corner (figs. <a href="#fig_6">6</a> and <a href="#fig_7">7</a>) is a strong corner,
and considerable experience is required in order to make a neat-looking
job. This type has several undesirable features: (1) The
logs are apt to develop a wide crack because the corner is framed
from the part of the log in which the least shrinkage occurs, and
(2) since the logs are hewed down to form the corner, the wood
has a tendency to collect and retain moisture which soon results in
decay. Also, this corner detracts noticeably from the &ldquo;loggy&rdquo; appearance
so characteristic and desirable in log structures. The drawings
in <a href="#fig_6">figure 6</a> show the most practical methods of marking and framing
the dovetail, or box, corner.</p>

<p>The flat, or plain, tenon corner (<a href="#fig_8">fig. 8</a>), is also common. It may
be made in two ways. In one, only the bearing surfaces are framed,
while in the other, all four sides of the tenon are framed flat. The
plain tenon corner does not have the highly desirable feature of
being self-locking. However, it is simple to make and economical,
and therefore especially suitable for temporary structures. The logs
must be pinned together, as shown in <a href="#fig_11">figure 11</a>. All the framing
can be done on the ground, before the logs are put in place. Carefully
fitted, this makes a neat-looking job.</p>

one end of log, as in <a href="#fig_8">figure 8</a>, at point <i>A</i>, then measure
required length and saw the opposite end square, at <i>B</i>. If the log
has any curvature, turn it on the skids until its back is up. Determine
the thickness of the tenons, based upon the average top and
butt diameters of the log. Then take an 18-inch length of board
the same width as the thickness of the tenons, driving a nail through
its center and into the center of the log. Place the spirit level on
top of the board and mark lines on the log at the top and bottom<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">« 8 »</a></span>
edges. The width of a tenon varies with the diameter of the logs;
8- to 10-inch diameters will produce 6- to 7-inch wide tenons.</p>

<p>Nail a 1 inch by 1 inch cleat on the pattern board to points <i>C</i> and
<i>D</i> and then make saw cuts on each end, cut chip off and smooth the
surface. Turn log over and repeat on the other side. After framing
out the sides of the tenon, the log is ready to be placed on the wall.
Some fitting between corners is usually necessary but, if the logs
are fairly straight and smooth, the work will be minimized.</p>

<p>The upright, or groove-and-tenon, corner (<a href="#fig_9">fig. 9</a>) is used to a
considerable extent in the West. It has desirable features from a
mechanical standpoint: (1) The weight of the building is carried
on the full length of the logs and does not rest solely on the corners,
as in other types, and (2) it makes a tight wall because no openings<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">« 11 »</a></span>
will develop between the logs. Although not difficult to construct,
the upright corner requires considerable mechanical skill and accuracy.
A good carpenter can frame the entire building on the ground
before any logs are placed on the foundation, after which it can be
erected in a very short time. Next to the round-notch corner the
upright, or groove-and-tenon corner, probably has the best appearance.</p>

<p>Door and window jambs should be framed just like the corners
except that only the back should be grooved. The door side, or face,
may be rabbeted or left smooth so that a separate wood door stop
may be nailed in place. If the logs are reasonably dry, from 3 to
4 inches should be left at each corner for settlement due to shrinkage;
otherwise, more or less space should be allowed, as conditions
require. In about 6 months the cap log will come down and close
this gap. Similar provisions should be made for settlement over
door and window openings.</p>

<p class="caption2"><a name="FLOOR_JOISTS" id="FLOOR_JOISTS">FLOOR JOISTS</a></p>


<p>As soon as the first round or tier of logs is laid, the floor joists
should be set in place, notching them into the bottom side logs. If
the building has a continuous masonry foundation, the joists may
be set on top of it, as in a frame building.</p>

<p>In order that the ends of the joists may have sufficient bearing on
the wall, it is necessary either to notch the ends into the side logs
or hew the latter off on the inside. A simple method is to cut the
notches in the side logs before they are rolled into place. Pole joists
should be from 4 to 8 inches in diameter and hewed level on the
upper side to provide a solid bearing for nailing the flooring. Several
different ways of framing the floor joists are shown in <a href="#fig_10">figure 10</a>.</p>



<hr class="chap" />

<p class="caption2"><a name="LAYING_THE_WALL_LOGS" id="LAYING_THE_WALL_LOGS">LAYING THE WALL LOGS</a></p>


<p>In laying the successive rounds of logs in the walls, several details
must be observed to keep them lined up so that the top logs form
a level seat for the roof framing. The corners should be kept as
level as possible as each round is laid. This can be done by measuring
vertically from the top of the floor joists, from time to time, as
a check. A variation of 1 inch in height will not cause a serious
difficulty.</p>

<p>The height of the corner&rsquo;s is regulated in two ways: (1) By
increasing or decreasing the depth of the notch, and (2) by reversing
the top and butt ends of the logs when laying them in the wall.</p>

<p>The logs should be fitted together as tightly as possible. In the
case of somewhat irregularly surfaced logs, it may be necessary to
smooth off certain portions of the under side of the upper log to
secure a tight fit. Only in exceptional instances, however, should
this be done to the top of the lower log.</p>

<p>The face of the logs on the inside of the building must be kept
plumb, that is, in the same vertical plane. An ordinary carpenter&rsquo;s,
or spirit, level may be used, but a 6- to 8-foot plumb board is considered
most satisfactory because of its greater length.</p>

<p>The logs should be pinned together with a wooden pin or large
spike (<a href="#fig_11">fig. 11</a>). Spiking is done by boring a &frac34;-inch hole halfway
through the upper log and continuing with a <sup>7</sup>&#8260;<sub>16</sub>-inch hole through
the bottom half. Then drive a 10- or 12-inch spike into place, or
until it penetrates half the next log below. The spikes should be
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">« 13 »</a></span>
staggered in alternate rounds or tiers of logs. If wooden pins are
used, fir or oak logs are preferable. Neither wooden pins nor spikes,
however, offer interference to the settling of the walls.</p>

<div class="fig_center" style="width: 406px;">

</div>

<p>The spike method is easier and quicker, and just as satisfactory
as the wooden pin. The logs should be pinned approximately 2 feet
from each corner and at each side of the window and door openings.
For small structures, where the alignment of the walls is not so
important, pinning may be eliminated, but it is essential to
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">« 14 »</a></span>
align larger buildings accurately in order to prevent individual logs from
springing out of place.</p>

<p>Where the use of logs having a decided curve, or sweep, is unavoidable
they should be set in the wall with the bow or back up. Such
logs may be straightened by making enough saw cuts in the upper
side of the curved surface to allow them to straighten out. The
cuts should be from one-third to one-half the depth of the log, or
slightly more, if necessary (<a href="#fig_12">fig. 12</a>).</p>

<p class="caption2"><a name="WINDOW_AND_DOOR_OPENINGS" id="WINDOW_AND_DOOR_OPENINGS">WINDOW AND DOOR OPENINGS</a></p>


<p>Early American log structures were characterized by relatively
dark interiors because window openings, designed for protective
purposes, were small and far apart. Since protection is no longer
a consideration, window frames may be of standard size and located
where they are most suitable for adequate day lighting.</p>

<p>As soon as the first round of logs and the floor joists are laid in
place, mark the location of door and window openings on the inside
face. Next saw out the door openings and chop out the notch in
the doorsill log to within an inch of the true or finished line, as shown
in <a href="#fig_13">figure 13</a>. Leave final cutting of the openings to the exact dimensions
until the window and door frames are to be placed in position,
thus insuring a good finished wood surface. Also, determine the
height of the openings above the floor line and mark them in figures
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">« 15 »</a></span>
on the bottom log for reference from time to time. The necessary
cuts should be made in the log directly over each opening before
placing it in position. When the log which carries the window
frame is reached, a notch must be made for it as for the doors.</p>

<div class="fig_caption"><span class="smcap">Figure 13.</span>&mdash;Cutting window and door openings.</div>
</div>

<p>To provide the necessary doors and windows, openings must be
cut in the walls after the logs have been placed in position. As
soon as a log in the wall is cut in two, the problem arises of how
to hold the loose ends in place. Also, the doors and windows require
the proper kind of frames to insure airtight closure between the
latter and the ends of the wall logs. The most practicable and
satisfactory method is to frame a vertical notch in the ends of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">« 16 »</a></span>
the wall logs, into which can be fitted a spline attached to the
back of the jamb or side-pieces of the door and window frames.
This method of framing holds the wall logs in place, allows them
to shrink and settle without hindrance, and makes a weathertight
joint between them and the door and window frames. The vertical
notch in the end of the wall logs may be framed by boring a 2-inch
auger hole in each log as it is laid in place. The hole should be
located so that, when the wall logs are sawed out for the opening,
the saw cut passes down through the edge of the hole nearest the
opening. It is then a simple matter to frame the notch to take the
spline. The inside face of the notch can be left rounded and the
spline chamfered to fit. To keep the holes in line from log to log,
use the plumb board illustrated in <a href="#fig_14">figure 14</a>.</p>

<p>There are two ways of making window and door frames&mdash;in three
pieces (two side jambs and one head jamb), or in four pieces (two
side jambs, one head jamb, and a sill piece). When a three-piece
frame is used, the bottom log of the opening is cut or shaped to
make the window or doorsill and the jamb pieces are then fitted to
the sill. If the jambs are framed from pieces of log slabbed on two
opposite sides, a presentable frame in keeping with the log character
of the structure is obtained. The window or door face of the jamb
pieces may be rabbeted for the windows and doors, respectively, or
they may have separate wooden pieces, known as stops, nailed on.
The spline on the back of the jamb may be rabbeted out, or a
2 inch by 2 inch piece of straight-grained wood nailed on. The
head jamb can be framed in the same way; it does not require a
spline on the back. Each side jamb has a dowel framed on each
end. The bottom dowel fits into a mortise in the sill and the top
dowel into a similar mortise in the head jamb.</p>

<p>In a four-piece frame, the sill log is cut with a slope, in the
customary way, and the jambs are fitted as for a three-piece frame.
<a href="#fig_15">Figure 15</a> illustrates the installation of three- and four-piece window
frames.</p>

</div>

<p>When the head jamb or top log over the opening is reached, the
frames are ready for installation. The opening is now cut out, the
sill fashioned, the vertical spline slot framed, and the head jamb log
cut out to fit over the opening. At this point, the amount of settlement
resulting from the shrinkage of the wall logs, as they dry out,
must be determined and a corresponding allowance provided in the
opening. This allowance is made between the upper side of the
headpiece of the frame and the bottom of the log directly over the
opening, and should be from 2&frac12; to 4 inches for a door 6 feet 8 inches
to 7 feet in height, or 1&frac12; to 3 inches for an ordinary double hung
window. The log over the opening should be notched out on the
under side so that it can be dropped in place after the frame has
been set in position.</p>

<p>When the type of window or door frame here described is used,
neither outside nor inside casings, sometimes called wood trim, are
required. The logs selected for the jamb material should be from
2 to 3 inches larger in diameter than the wall logs, in order to fit
properly. Also, they will be much easier to work if well-seasoned
(<a href="#fig_16">fig. 16</a>).</p>

<p>If standard mill work frames are used, false side jambs of sawed
material, usually 2-inch planks, should be fitted in the openings to
hold the logs in place. For a wall made of 10-inch logs, a plank
2 inches by 10 inches should be used for the jambs and the standard
frame fitted in place between them after providing the necessary
allowance for the wall logs to shrink or settle. The head casing
ordinarily will cover the space allowed for shrinkage.</p>

<p>Some kind of insulating material which will take compression,
such as crumpled newspapers, asbestos wool fiber, or rock wool, may
be used to fill the space over the head allowed for settlement. Insulating
material must be installed loosely, so as not to take any weight
as the headlog gradually settles.</p>

<p>For the log-type frame, copper or galvanized steel flashing should
be fastened to the bottom of the cut in the top log, leaving the lower
edge of the flashing free to slide on the face of the log head jamb.
As the wall settles, the bottom of the flashing can be trimmed off if
too much of the face of the head jamb is covered. This makes a
weathertight joint and protects the insulating material with which
the shrinkage space has been filled. See <a href="#fig_17">figure 17</a>, Head section.</p>

<p>Roofs may be framed in several ways, depending upon the kind
of material available and the appearance desired. The framing for
a shingle roof, whether of sawed material or round poles, is done
in the same way as that of a frame building. The top log on the
wall may be cut with a flat seat for the rafters to rest upon, as at <i>Y</i>,
in <a href="#fig_18">figure 18, <i>A</i></a> or notched out to receive them as at <i>Z</i> in <a href="#fig_18">figure 18, <i>B</i></a>.
The gable ends may be run up with the logs, which is preferable for
architectural appearance, or framed like the gables of a frame structure,
and then covered with wood siding, shingles, or shakes (<a href="#fig_19">fig. 19</a>).</p>

<p>The shingles may be laid over sheathing boards in the usual
manner or on shingle strips placed across the roof rafters, parallel
with the ridge and exactly spaced to receive them, commonly known
as &ldquo;barn-fashion.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The particular method to be followed in framing the eaves depends
largely upon their projection. Where the effect of a considerable
overhang is desired, an eave purlin log may be used to support the
projecting shakes as shown in <a href="#fig_19">figure 19, <i>A</i></a>. To support 30- to 36-inch
long shakes having a 6-inch lap, the log purlins should be
spaced at approximately 24-inch intervals, as in <a href="#fig_19">figure 19</a>. In regions
of heavy snows, the eave log may be placed slightly forward to
help support the overhang, or an additional eave log may be placed
in position, as shown in <a href="#fig_19">figure 19, <i>B</i></a>. The gable logs should be run
up at the same time as the roof logs, and both rigidly framed
together.</p>

<div class="fig_caption"><span class="smcap">Figure 20.</span>&mdash;Splitting shakes with the froe.</div>
</div>

<p>It is often desirable to use hand-split shakes for the roof covering.
These are usually made from cedar, but may be of any straight-grained
wood, free from knots, which splits easily. First, the logs
are cut in lengths of 30 to 36 inches and then the shakes are split
off with a tool called a froe (<a href="#fig_20">fig. 20</a>).</p>

<p>After the log cuts are set on end, the froe is held on the upper
end of the block and then struck a blow with a wooden maul which
causes a piece of the block or shake to split off. Being hand-split,
the thickness varies somewhat; the minimum is &frac12; inch. A roof of
thin shingles, lacking sufficient scale, is never as effective as a rough
textured one, using &frac34;- to 1&frac14;-inch thick shakes, to harmonize with
the sturdy appearance of the log walls. The width, normally 6 to 8
inches, is governed by the size of the blocks of wood and varies
accordingly, while the length is governed by the spacing of the roof
logs or purlins. Shakes are always laid on the purlins in single
courses, lapping the sides 1&frac12; to 2 inches and over-lapping the ends
at least 6 inches, as illustrated in <a href="#fig_19">figure 19</a>. Nailing is usually done
with six- or eight-penny galvanized box nails. Copper nails may
be used for greater permanence. A good shake roof will not leak
although from the inside of the building it may appear to have
many holes.</p>

<p>The ordinary, uninteresting, straight-line effect at the butts may
be broken up by staggering them from 1 to 2 inches, as is often
done with shingles. This method produces an effect more in keeping
with the log walls. Although involving greater care and additional
labor it is preferable, from an architectural point of view, to the
more common custom of laying them to uniformly straight lines.</p>

<p>At the ridge of the roof, where the shingles or shakes intersect,
provisions must be made for weatherproofing. The shingled Boston
ridge, comb intersection, or pole ridge, shown in <a href="#fig_21">figure 21</a> are practical
and much more satisfactory from the standpoint of architectural
effect than stock metal ridges, ridge boards, and other methods.</p>

two different methods may be used to construct the partition walls.
If the log construction plan is to be carried throughout the structure
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">« 24 »</a></span>
by using interior log-wall partitions, these should be laid out and
framed in, and the door openings cut in the same manner as previously
described for exterior walls. If a log partition comes at a
place in a cross wall where it is not considered desirable to have
the log ends project into the room beyond the opposite face of the
wall, they may be sawed off flush with the face of the cross wall,
as shown at <i>X</i>, <a href="#fig_22">figure 22</a>, Plan <i>A</i>. This will not weaken the joint
since the logs are both pinned and locked in place.</p>

<p>Where frame partitions are used, they should be constructed as
in a frame building. A gain or a 3- to 4-inch deep groove should
be cut in the log wall into which the end studding of the frame
partition is to be set (<a href="#fig_22">fig. 22</a>, Plan <i>B</i>). The cut should be made in
each log before it is placed in the wall. In no case should the
studding at the ends of the partitions be nailed to the log walls
which they intersect in order not to interfere with or be affected
by their shrinkage and settlement.</p>

<p>A subfloor should be laid first using shiplap or sheathing. Over
this a finished floor of such hardwoods as maple or oak, or the
harder softwood species such as Douglas-fir, western larch, or
southern pine, may be laid. Vertical grain and flat grain may be
had in both softwood and hardwood, but the vertical grain shrinks
and swells less than the flat, is more uniform in texture, wears more
evenly, and the joints open much less. Finished flooring consists
or tongue-and-groove material of various thicknesses and widths.</p>

<p>Despite a slight tendency to splinter and wear irregularly over
a period of years, plain wide planking of random-width boards
makes an appropriate floor for a log building. An attractive effect
may be had by using screws instead of nails, countersunk to a depth
of &frac12; inch and concealed by inserting false wooden dowels glued in
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">« 25 »</a></span>
place as shown in <a href="#fig_23">figure 23</a>, <i>B</i>. Keying the boards together with
wood keys, at random along the edges, adds to the attractiveness of
the flooring.</p>

<p>Hanging doors and windows, and many other customary details
of building construction should be done in the usual manner in
building with logs. Whenever cupboards or other built-in units are
constructed, they must be framed to be independent or entirely free
of the log walls, like the furniture. However, such fixtures as lavatories
may be attached to two adjacent logs without any subsequent
structural complications.</p>

<p class="caption2"><a name="CALKING" id="CALKING">CALKING</a></p>


<p>When round logs are laid up in a wall there is always an opening
between them unless they are grooved on the under side to saddle the
one below, as described later under chinkless log cabin construction.
In exterior walls, this opening, or crack, must be closed in order
to make the structure weathertight. There are several methods of
doing this. If the logs are reasonably straight and uniform in size
and the corners carefully made, the opening between them will be
small, often barely perceptible. When this is the case, the openings
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">« 26 »</a></span>
should be filled with some sort of calking compound applied with
either a pressure gun or a trowel (<a href="#fig_24">fig. 24</a>).</p>

<div class="fig_center" style="width: 395px;">
<a id="fig_24" name="fig_24"></a>

<div class="fig_caption"><span class="smcap">Figure 24.</span>&mdash;Examples of tight joints well calked. <i>A</i>, Interior calking;
<i>B</i>, exterior calking.</div>
</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">« 27 »</a></span></p>

<p>In recent years several kinds of calking material have been put
on the market. They are applied best with a gun having a pressure-release
trigger whereby the calking compound is forced through a
nozzle made in various shapes and sizes to meet different requirements.
These calking compounds are not adversely affected by heat
or cold, retain their natural flexibility, and have an adhesive property
which causes them to adhere to the surface to which they are
applied.</p>

<p>A good plastic compound will adhere to the logs under all conditions
and can be patched easily by simply applying more material.
A black fiber seal is not objectionable and, at the same time, gives
a practical finish. The seal should be applied to both sides of the
exterior and interior log walls, producing an almost hermetically
sealed building. When applied with a pressure gun having a &#8540;-inch
nozzle, 1 gallon will fill about 300 linear feet of opening. If applied
in cold weather, the material should be heated to a temperature of
60°F.</p>



<hr class="chap" />

<p class="caption2"><a name="CHINKING" id="CHINKING">CHINKING</a></p>


<p>When using logs that are somewhat rough and irregular in shape,
the resulting space between them may be so large that the calking
material cannot be used satisfactorily to fill the opening. In such
cases, it will be necessary to insert &ldquo;chinking,&rdquo; which usually is
applied to the interior and exterior walls in one of two ways:</p>

<p>1. <i>Split chinking.</i>&mdash;Segments of a log are split out in sizes which
fit the opening and, after being carefully shaped with the ax to
make a tight fit, are securely nailed in position. This kind of chinking
requires considerable work and patience to secure a good appearance.</p>


<div class="fig_right" style="width: 127px;">

<div class="fig_caption"><span class="smcap">Figure 25.</span>&mdash;Pole chinking.</div>
</div>

<p>2. <i>Pole chinking.</i>&mdash;Small round poles may be used to fill the
openings (<a href="#fig_25">fig. 25</a>). Usually they are cut in sizes and lengths to fill
the opening from wall to wall. This sort of chinking may be applied
rapidly to either inside or outside walls and makes a neater job than
the preceding method. Unless the logs are thoroughly seasoned these
small poles sometimes have a tendency to pull away from the nails.
When the chinking has been completed, the openings will have been
reduced sufficiently in width to allow the calking material to be
applied successfully.</p>

<p>It is always a serious problem in log construction to devise a
practical method for permanently fastening the plaster daubing in
place on both inside and outside walls. In some instances, shingle
nails may be driven into the logs 2 to 3 inches apart for the full
length of the opening or 2-inch wide strips of metal lath may be
used and the plaster applied to fill it. Cattle hair may be added
to the plaster to increase its adhesive consistency and thereby hold
it more rigidly in place. Sometimes, wood strips are nailed on the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">« 28 »</a></span>
lower log to hold the plaster in position, as shown in <a href="#fig_26">figure 26</a>, but
they are unsightly.</p>

<p class="caption2"><a name="CHINKLESS_LOG_CABIN_CONSTRUCTION" id="CHINKLESS_LOG_CABIN_CONSTRUCTION">CHINKLESS LOG CABIN CONSTRUCTION</a></p>


<p>Chinkless construction, associated with the building of log structures
in Scandinavian countries, eliminates the chinking and
mudding so prevalent in many log buildings. It consists of grooving
the under side of every log in each tier so that it saddles the log
beneath, making a close joint for its entire length. The groove is
marked by a tool which, for convenience, may be called a cabin
scribe or a drag (<a href="#fig_27">fig. 27</a>).</p>

<p><i>Directions for chinkless log cabin construction.</i>&mdash;-Mark and cut
out the notch just as is done for a round-notch corner. Next, dog
the log in place and scribe, making the additional mark shown by
dash line (<i>X</i>, <a href="#fig_27">fig. 27</a>). Then, cut to line and, finally, drop log in
position.</p>

<p>The scribe is 12 inches long, made preferably of &#8540;-inch square
steel or iron bent in much the same manner as the spring in a steel
trap; the two ends are turned down about 1&frac12; inches like two fingers,
diverging to about &frac34; of an inch at the points, and then sharpened
with a flat surface on the inside of the point toward the loop. The
loop should be hammered out thin to provide sufficient flexibility to
allow the points to spread or close easily. A ring is welded around
the two halves of the tool which, when slipped up or down, makes
it possible to adjust the points and thereby prevent any further
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">« 29 »</a></span>
spreading while the tool is in use. A link from a small chain, placed
over the legs before the points are turned, will serve the same purpose
and, to prevent the points from springing together, a small piece of
wood may be forced between them.</p>

<p>To fit a log, first frame it at the ends and then fit it down to within
about 2 inches of the lower log where the opening is the widest
It is difficult to do a good job of scribing when the logs are too
close together. The scribe must then be adjusted at the point where
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">« 30 »</a></span>
the opening is the widest so that, when holding the tool parallel
to the opening, the lower point of the scribe will ride on the surface
of the bottom log. By exerting sufficient pressure, the upper point
will score the top log. Repeat this operation to score the upper log
on the other side. The corner tenons must be marked likewise. Next,
turn the log over, work the tenons down and then cut a <span style="font-weight: bolder; font-size: 1.15em">V</span>-shaped
groove to the marked lines in the remaining portion of the log, using
a double-bitted ax. This groove should be cut deep enough along
its center to permit the outer edge of the groove to rest continuously
on the lower log. By removing the least amount of wood to make
the smallest possible groove, the closest fit is obtained with the least
effort.</p>

</div>

<p>The principle of the scribe is based on parallel lines, and it can
readily be seen that if there is a hump on the lower log there will
have to be a gouge in the upper one. When the work is done carefully,
the space remaining is negligible. Where an airtight wall
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">« 31 »</a></span>
is desired, a strip of plumber&rsquo;s oakum should be laid on the bottom
log before the upper log is dropped into place. If this material is
not available, dry moss is a fairly practical substitute.</p>


<p class="caption3"><a id="Milled-Log_Construction" name="Milled-Log_Construction"></a>Milled-Log Construction</p>

<p>Sometimes it is feasible to take advantage of a portable mill to
face the logs on three sides rather than to hew them by hand. The
level beds seat the logs so well that calking is minimized, the smooth
interior surfaces permit of easy finishing, particularly where wood
wainscoting or plaster is used, while the round-log exterior effect
is undisturbed, except where the logs project at the corners. <a href="#fig_28">Figure 28</a>
illustrates a structure built in this way.</p>

<p>The facing or hewing of round timbers to obtain one or two sides
surfaced flat for framing purposes, as shown in <a href="#fig_29">figure 29</a>, requires
considerable skill in the use of the ax and broadax. There are,
however, a number of mechanical aids (<a href="#fig_30">fig. 30</a>) which should be
used by anyone undertaking log construction in order to simplify
the work as much as possible. The carpenter&rsquo;s spirit level, the steel
square, and chalk line and chalk are necessary for laying off the
lines to be followed in hewing timbers. In framing logs they should
be laid up on skids, or sawhorses, dogged fast in place with iron
dogs, and the dimensions laid off on each end of the log with the
level and square to insure that the lines are parallel to each other.
Then, with the chalk line, carefully snap lines on the side of the log
connecting corresponding points at each end. For squaring the ends
of a log and cutting pole rafters, use the miter box to guide the
saw. To measure lengths accurately the steel tape, or a board pattern
cut to the exact length, may be used.</p>

<p>The living-room fireplace, invariably the most prominent interior
feature, harmonizes best with a log interior if built of stone and
provided with a crude log shelf. The fireplace itself may be either
the traditional masonry type or the more modern metal-lined one
equipped with a heatilator.</p>

<p>The masonry of the fireplace and its chimney should always start
on solid earth, below the frost line, like the foundations of the building
itself. Masonry does not settle, unlike the surrounding log
construction. Consequently, it is recommended that a self-supporting
log framing be built around and entirely free of the masonry
of the fireplace and chimney, as illustrated in <a href="#fig_31">figure 31</a>. The opening
should be framed in the same way as window and door openings.
The fireplace and chimney masonry should not be erected until the
opening has been framed for it. Upon completion, the intersection
between the stone and wood should be thoroughly calked to make
an airtight, weatherproof job. This method allows the wall logs
to settle, because of the unavoidable shrinkage, without structural
failure.</p>

<p>After all the openings have been properly calked and the logs
brushed clean, it is often desirable, although not absolutely necessary,
to treat the log surfaces with some sort of preservative material.
Logwood oil is excellent for the exterior. The colorless variety is
preferable in most cases but, if some color is desired, add just enough
burnt umber, or raw sienna paste, to give the proper shade. For
interior finish, apply a coat of clear shellac and then one or two
coats of dull varnish. The trim can be treated in a similar manner

<p>The matter of interior furnishings is always of great concern
to those who build log cabins. Odds and ends or too many &ldquo;what-nots&rdquo;
may prove to be misfits. Pieces of Early American design
are perhaps the most appropriate ready-made furniture, but sturdy,
rustic pieces yield the greatest satisfaction.</p>

<p>Many cabin owners have found a great deal of pleasure in making
essential furniture, such as bunks, beds, tables, chairs, settees, and
similar items. In the East, birch is preferred as a material, and in
the West, lodgepole pine is most satisfactory. Other native species,
however, will do just as well. In making furniture it is advisable
to remove the bark from the logs because bark collects insects, causes
the wood to deteriorate and eventually falls off, leaving imperfect,
unsightly surfaces. Figures <a href="#fig_36">36</a> and <a href="#fig_37">37</a> show types of furniture suitable
for log residences.</p>

<p>For rustic effects, the use of a stain of the following proportions
gives a satisfactory appearance: 2 quarts turpentine, 2 quarts raw
linseed oil, and 1 pint liquid drier, to which add &frac12; pint of raw
sienna, &frac12; pint of burnt umber, and a touch of burnt sienna. The
top surfaces of tables, buffets, chests, and rawhide seats should have
two coats of spar varnish. Where countersunk screws are used in
connection with a stain finish, insert false wood, dowel-like plugs
in preference to plastic wood to conceal the screwheads.</p>

<p>Simplicity, both in construction and appearance, is the keynote
for producing the most harmonious effects in furniture, in keeping
with log interiors.</p>


<p class="caption3"><a id="Chairs_and_Stools" name="Chairs_and_Stools"></a>Chairs and Stools</p>

<p>Armchairs can be built with well-seasoned lodgepole or eastern
pine, or birch (<a href="#fig_38">fig. 38</a>). The cornerpieces should be mortised and
tenoned to the frame and rail and anchored in place with &#8540;- by
15-inch lag screws. The arms should be fastened to the cornerpieces
with &#8540;- by 5-inch carriage bolts and to the slab support with
&#8540;- by 4-inch lag screws. The vertical slab support should be rigidly
secured to the frame with &#8540;- by 3-inch carriage bolts. Cushions
may be of the filler type, without springs, and covered with homespun
fabric. Use 2-inch wide heavy canvas strips, securely fastened
with furniture tacks, to support the cushions.</p>

<p>Upright chairs and stools (<a href="#fig_39">fig. 39</a>) can be made from the same

The crosspieces of the chair back should be curved to fit the human
back. The joints must be tightly glued, mortised, and tenoned.</p>

<p>Birch or well-seasoned lodgepole or eastern pine is suitable for
making a bed or bunk. In making a bed (<a href="#fig_40">fig. 40</a>) the crosspieces
should impale the corner posts tightly; the joints should be glued
and toe-nailed from below. Do not cut the side or end pieces until
the bedspring has been measured and then allow for a slight play
in both directions in setting the angle irons, in order to facilitate
the insertion and removal of the mattress. Use 14- by 3-inch carriage
bolts to fasten the angle irons to the wood frame. <a href="#fig_40">Figure 40</a>

accordingly.</p>

Join the corner poles to the slab frame and rail with mortise-and-tenon
joints; then anchor the joints by means of &#8540;- by 6 -inch lag
screws. Fasten the arms to the corner poles with &#8540;- by 5-inch
carriage bolts and to the slab support with &#8540;- by 4-inch lag screws.
Use &#8540;- by 3-inch carriage bolts to fasten the slab support to the
frame. The 1- by 2-inch hardwood crosspieces should be securely
fastened at the top ends and notched into the legs at the bottom
ends, held by 2-inch wood screws, driven into place at an angle.
Back slats should be mortised and tenoned to the rail and frame.
The cushions should be the filler type, without springs if so desired,
and covered with homespun fabric.</p>

shelf should be rabbeted and thoroughly glued. The two intermediate
shelves can be made adjustable by boring 3 holes in each
side-piece 2 inches apart, above and below the position shown for
the shelves in <a href="#fig_46">figure 46</a>, into which loose wooden pins may be inserted

1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg-tm collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain "Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.

of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project

received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person

violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the

additions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any
Defect you cause.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
